I feel cheerful and in good spirits
I feel calm and relaxed
I feel active and vigorous
I wake up feeling fresh and rested
I feel that I am coping well with life
I feel confident and positive about myself
I am able to concentrate without difficulty
I do not feel overwhelmed by problems
I feel hopeful about the future
I have a good balance between work and personal life
